# GEMINI.md - AI-Generated Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the **LMS MAI Quiz Solver** project, generated by an AI assistant to facilitate understanding and future development.

## Project Overview

This is a browser extension for Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers designed to assist users in solving quizzes on the Moodle-based Learning Management System (LMS) at `lms.mai.ru`.

The extension is built as a modern web application using **React** and **TypeScript**. The build process is managed by **Vite**, which bundles the code into the necessary JavaScript and CSS files. Styling is done using **Tailwind CSS**.

The project consists of several key parts:
- A **popup interface** (`action`) that serves as the main dashboard, showing statistics and instructions.
- **Content scripts** that are injected into Moodle quiz pages to provide in-page functionality like finding and saving answers.
- A **background service worker** that manages extension state and communication, including API interactions.
- A **server-side component** running on Cloudflare Workers, which provides an API for syncing answers and statistics between users.

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Browser Extension API:** Chrome Manifest V3
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers (JavaScript)

## Building and Running

The project uses `npm` for dependency management and running scripts.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.

### Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command in the project's root directory:
```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To build the extension and have it watch for changes, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will compile the assets and place them in their respective directories (`js`, `css`, `html`).

To load the extension in your browser for development:
1. Open your browser's extension management page (e.g., `chrome://extensions`).
2. Enable "Developer mode".
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the root directory of this project.

### Production Build

To create a production-ready build of the extension, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command will build and minify the assets for release.

## Development Conventions

- The project uses **React with functional components and hooks**.
- **TypeScript** is used for static typing, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- The UI is built with **Tailwind CSS**, following a utility-first approach.
- The project is divided into multiple React applications (e.g., `popup`, `saved-data`), each with its own `index.html` entry point in the `src` directory. Vite is configured to handle this multi-page setup.
- Asynchronous operations in the extension (like accessing `chrome.storage`) are handled using `async/await`.
